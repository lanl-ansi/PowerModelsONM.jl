# Introduction to PowerModelsONM

This is a stub for an interactive Pluto.jl tutorial contained in [examples](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsONM.jl/tree/main/examples).

During documentation build time, this tutorial will be automatically converted to HTML, but will lose its interactivity.

To experience the full interactivity of this notebook please install Pluto.jl, and open [this file](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsONM.jl/tree/main/examples/Beginners%20Guide.jl)

## Installing and running Pluto.jl

Run Julia and add the package:

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.6) pkg> add Pluto
```

_Using the package manager for the first time after installing Julia can take up to 15 minutes - hang in there!_

To run the notebook server:

```julia
julia> import Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```

Pluto will open in your browser, and you can get started!
