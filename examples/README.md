# PowerModelsONM Tutorials

To run these tutorial notebooks, you will want to use Pluto.jl:

## Installing and running Pluto.jl

Run Julia and add the package:

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.6) pkg> add Pluto
```

_Using the package manager for the first time after installing Julia can take up to 15 minutes - hang in there!_

To run the notebook server:

```julia
julia> import Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```

Pluto will open in your browser, and you can get started!
