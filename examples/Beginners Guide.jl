# Introduction to PowerModelsONM

This is an introduction to using PowerModelsONM, a Julia/JuMP library for optimizing the operations of networked microgrids.

To use PowerModelsONM, you will need to install the package via 

- `Pkg.add()` and `PackageSpec` (see below), 
- download one of the binaries from [PowerModelsONM Releases](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsONM.jl/releases) (experimental), or 
- build a docker image locally with our included [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsONM.jl/blob/main/Dockerfile).

In this Pluto notebook, we will install via the built-in Julia Package Manager:

## How to use PowerModelsONM

PowerModelsONM is designed to have a straightforward workflow for optimizing the operation and recovering of distribution feeders under contingencies.

In particular, the workflow consists of sequential steps of 

- data processing and preparation, which includes inputs such as
  - the base network (OpenDSS format)
  - timeseries data (contained in the DSS files)
  - events data, which contains the contingencies (json, see `models/events.v1.json`)
  - settings data, which contains supplemental information about the network model not supported in DSS (json, see `models/settings.v1.json`)
  - inverters data, which contains information about inverters for stability analysis (json, see `models/inverters.v1.json` and [PowerModelsStability documentation](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsStability.jl)
  - faults data, which contains pre-built faults over which to iterate during fault studies (json, see `models/faults.v1.json` and [PowerModelsProtection documentation](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsProtection.jl)
- optimal switching (osw) / maximal load delivery (mld) problem
- optimal dispatch (OPF) problem
- statistical analysis and outputs, which includes information about
  - device action timeline, such as the switch configurations at every timestep and which loads have been shed by the algorithm,
  - microgrid statistics, such as min, mean, max voltages, storage state of charge, analysis of load served, analysis of generation sources, etc.
  - Powerflow outputs, which contains dispatch setpoints and bus voltage magnitudes
  - Small signal stability results
  - Fault analysis results 

### Inputs

The first and foremost piece of data you will need is the network definition files in OpenDSS format. For more information on what is currently supported see [PowerModelsDistribution](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsDistribution.jl).

Using `parse_network` will return a `network`, which is a "multinetwork" representation of the timeseries contained in the DSS specification, and `base_network`, which is the topological reality of the system, without the expansion into a multinetwork.
"""

# ╔═╡ 4891479c-9eb5-494e-ad1f-9bd52a171c57
base_network, network = parse_network(joinpath(data_dir, "IEEE13Nodeckt_mod.dss"))


# ╔═╡ e1f1b7cf-d8ad-432d-ac98-95860e1ec65d
md"""
multinetworks are data structures which contains a full network definition under `"nw"` with the time varying values written directly to that copy.

Each timestep, or "subnetwork", will be indexed by the string representation of an integer, in order.

For example, the timestep named `"2"`, which corresponds in this case to timestep `2.0` (which you can find under `"mn_lookup"`), can be explored like this:
"""

# ╔═╡ f7636969-d29b-415e-8fe4-d725b6fa97d0
network["nw"]["2"]


# ╔═╡ 1b10ab40-5b24-4370-984d-cce1de0f95f5
md"""
### Contingencies (Events)

To apply a contingency to a network, we need to define a contingency using the events schema.

In this example, we load a contingency where in timestep 1 a switching action isolates a microgrid, and ensures that another switch always stays closed (because it is a fuse).
"""

# ╔═╡ e941118d-5b63-4886-bacd-82291f4c01c4

# ╔═╡ 353e797c-6155-4d7b-bb79-440d7b8f8ae2
md"""
These events are "raw events", in that they have not yet been parsed into the native network data format. These raw events are a vector, in order, that defines a sequence of events.

To parse the events into the native format, we need to have the network data
"""

# ╔═╡ 05454fe0-2368-4c67-ad82-bec852c56b85

As you can see, this structure now looks much more like the native network definition, allowing you to see how we parse events into actual actions in the timeseries representation.

To apply these events to a network, we can use `apply_events`, which will return a copy of the original network data structure.

md"""
### Settings

There are many things that cannot be easily represented in the DSS specification, specifically relating to optimization bounds, which is not the use case for OpenDSS. To support specifying these extra types of settings, we have created a settings JSON Schema.

In this example, we load some settings that set the maximum allowed switching actions at each timestep (`"max_switch_actions"`), how much time has elapsed during each timestep (`"time_elapsed"`, in hours), and a cold-load pickup factor (`"clpu_factor"`) for each load.

## Analysis

In this next section we will cover the different optimization problems and analyses that we can perform with PowerModelsONM.

### Optimization Solvers

In order to actually solve any of the optimization problems within PowerModelsONM, you will need to initialize some optimization solvers.

PowerModelsONM has several solvers built-in in case you don't want to create your own, and can be created with `build_solver_instances`, which will ouput a Dictionary with

- `"nlp_solver"`: Ipopt
- `"mip_solver"`: Cbc
- `"minlp_solver"`: Alpine with Ipopt and Cbc
- `"misocp_solver"`: Juniper with Ipopt and Cbc

"""

solvers = build_solver_instances()


# ╔═╡ 8ce619a2-fe39-4b77-beda-bde92878cb86
md"""
### Optimal Switching (osw / mld)

Now that we have a network with contingencies and settings, we want to solve a optimal switching / mld problem.

First, it should be noted that because loads are most typically not individually controllable in distribution feeders, with a few notable exceptions, loads must largely be shed by isolating a load block with switching actions. A load block is defined as a block of buses which can be fully isolated from the grid by opening one or more _operable_ switches.

To accomodate this reality, we can extended PowerModelsDistribution by adding the ability to assign load status variables to multiple loads (_i.e._, by block), and adding constraints that isolate blocks of load that are desired to be shed to maintain operability of the rest of the grid.

Second, the optimal switching problem currently uses the LinDist3Flow model (`PowerModelsDistribution.LPUBFDiagModel`), which is a quadratic approximation, due to the presence of mixed integers. 

Finally, the optimial switching problem currently solves sequentially, rather than globally over the entire multinetwork, which means switch configurations and storage energies are manually updated after each timestep is solved.

To run the optimal switching problem, use `optimize_switches`
"""

# ╔═╡ 484fc544-157e-4fda-a97b-3c791063b1b8
optimal_switching_results = optimize_switches(network_events_settings, solvers["misocp_solver"])


# ╔═╡ e5a55ef5-e3df-40a3-b0bf-cb6b4a1fec2d
md"""
The result is a dictionary, indexed by the subnetwork indexes discussed before, with the results of each timestep, where the actual solution is contained under `"solution"`.
"""

# ╔═╡ 53c406c3-5312-41b6-a774-55d7406ce4d0
optimal_switching_results["1"]["solution"]


# ╔═╡ cfe3ba9f-7bbb-4d1e-a0da-b0e262017779
md"""
### Optimal Dispatch (opf)

Because the optimal switching is performed with a) a linear approximation, and b) sequentially, it is advisable to run a separate optimal dispatch solve on the resulting multinetwork

First though, we will want to propagate the switch configuration to the multinetwork data structure using `apply_switch_solutions!`.
"""

# ╔═╡ 9733ae2e-5d24-4c7c-ad95-2a7f88fbe249
network_events_settings_osw = apply_switch_solutions(network_events_settings, optimal_switching_results)

		for (_,bus) in nw["bus"]
			delete!(bus, "vm_lb")
			delete!(bus, "vm_ub")
		end
	end

Then we can run `optimize_dispatch` on the resulting network, in this case using the ACR Unbalanced model from PowerModelsDistribution and our NLP solver.

### Fault Analysis (fs)

Fault analysis is brought to PowerModelsONM courtesy of PowerModelsProtection.

It should be noted that if no faults are pre-defined, as they are in this example, faults will be automatically generated iteratively and can end up taking a significant time to solve depending on the size of the network.

Here we use an example faults file from our unit tests.

## Statistics and Outputs

In this section we will cover the different built-in statistical analysis functions included in PowerModelsONM.

The various results dictionaries can all be used in different ways, and you should not feel limited to the analyses included in PowerModelsONM.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

If you are having trouble getting your network to solve, the first place to look will be the optimization bounds. While DSS is an excellent format for defining networks, including their topology and time series data, it is not intended to define bounds for optimization problems, which is what we are attempting to solve here.

In many cases, the default bounds from DSS are either much too restrictive, such as in the case of line limits, or completely non-existant, such as in the case of bus voltage bounds or line angle different bounds.
